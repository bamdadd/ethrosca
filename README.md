# ETH ROSCA

## Description
A ROSCA is an unofficial financial organization made up of a group of people who regularly contribute to and take from a shared pool of money.

In a ROSCA, participants collectively contribute to a joint fund, usually with monthly payments. Each cycle, one member receives the total amount as a one-time payment. This process repeats as long as the group remains active.

*Example of a ROSCA*:
Imagine setting up a ROSCA for 1 ETH (Ethereum). The organizer finds nine trustworthy individuals, each agreeing to contribute a portion of the 1 ETH every month to the collective fund.

In the first monthly meeting, the organizer takes home 1 ETH as a lump sum. At the second meeting, another member receives the next 1 ETH. This process continues until each participant has had a turn with the Ethereum. After 10 months, when everyone has received their distribution, the ROSCA might either disband or initiate another round.
